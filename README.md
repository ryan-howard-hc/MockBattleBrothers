## Grid Layout:

### grid system to arrange tiles or cells. Unity's GridLayoutGroup or Tilemap can help with this, depending on your game's requirements. Each cell represents a space on the game board.

## Tiles or Cells:

###  GameObjects or prefabs to represent different types of tiles or cells on the game board. In Battle Brothers, you have different terrain types and obstacles, so you might want to create different prefabs for each.

## Tile Data:

### Attach script components to tile prefabs to store data related to each tile, such as terrain type, whether it's occupied, and any other relevant properties.

## Tile Placement:

### Place the tiles on the grid according to game's design. This could be done manually in the Unity editor or procedurally using scripts.

## Character Units:

### Create GameObjects to represent characters or units in your game, and place them on the grid. These units can have scripts attached to manage their behavior, movement, and interactions.

## Input Handling:

### Implement input handling to allow players to interact with the game board. This may involve selecting units, moving them, and taking actions.

## Turn-Based System:

### If game is turn-based like Battle Brothers, wil need a system to manage turns for different units or players. Can implement this with a finite state machine or a similar approach.

## Game Logic:

### Develop the game logic for combat, movement, and other interactions between units and the game board.

## User Interface (UI):

### Design and implement UI elements to display game information, such as unit stats, turn order, and any other relevant data.

## Camera Control:

### Implement camera controls to allow players to navigate and view the game board.

## Game Flow and Win/Loss Conditions:

### Add mechanisms to manage the flow of the game and determine win/loss conditions.


# AFTER/DURING:

## Testing and Iteration:

### Continuously playtest and iterate on game board component to ensure it's fun and balanced.

## Graphics and Visuals:

### Implement graphics, animations, and visual effects to make game board visually appealing.
